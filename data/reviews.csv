Amazon Customer,4.0,2022 21 September,"
We upgraded from an old basic Oster to this model. The Oster seemed to be dying.Overall it’s nice, it just doesn’t always blend all larger chunks, especially frozen fruit. Maybe there’s a trick to how to load it, or to phase load the blender for smoothies. I’ve heard great things about Ninja products, and we also just bought an air fryer. This one has been a little disappointing.My other least favorite thing is it’s trickier to clean. There are many crevices things seem to rest and get stuck. So that’s slightly annoying.I love the capacity for a family of four. I love the lid design. I love how the blade comes out, and the bottom doesn’t have to come off. That way it’s always aligned and it locks easily on to the motor base.It’s nice, but could use some design improvements I guess.

You get what you pay for and you will.not find a better blender at this price point. This blender is just as good as my $300 VitamiX!! Do yourself a favor, don't buy cheap Walmart blenders. Get yourself a Ninja, you'll be glad you did!
"
Amanda Bailey,5.0,2022 3 October,"
Absolutely love!! Big smoothie gal so obviously perfect for that. But it’s made me become some what of a *chef* I’ve made a bunch of sauces in it too!! If you’re thinking about getting it… stop thinking and just do it :)
"
Alexis Reel,5.0,2022 16 September,"
I love this blender! I’ve made smoothies, sauces, and cocktails in it. It blends really well, and sometimes my smoothies come out to airy, but it still tastes good. The blade comes out easily to clean, but cleaning the blade entirely can be a little difficult and somewhat hard since the blade is really really sharp. The only drawback. I would highly recommend!!
"
Kari Crump,5.0,2022 25 September,"
Blends very well.  I was looking for a blender that worked well without having to put in a lot of liquid.  This blender works well with limited liquid and doesn't leave chunks.
"
Sue Brown,5.0,2022 6 September,"
So happy with this blender! I can’t believe we waited so long to buy a blender; we’re now using this almost daily. The blender is super easy to use and very powerful. My only complaint is that it can be hard to clean down in the crevices of the blade and base if you don’t clean it out right away. But that’s my own fault! Would definitely recommend!
"
Gurbie,5.0,2022 1 October,"
We use this blender primarily for smoothies and it does an awesome job of blending frozen fruits!!!
"
kmk,5.0,2022 24 July,"
Pros:Easy to use—only three parts, guidelines on base help you see how to put the container on. Three easy buttons. Does not require tamping the food into the blade.Base is sleek and solid.Blades are VERY sharp. Be careful.Easy to clean. The blade comes out and rinses clean. The container is wide enough to reach into with a cloth. Beats the pricier Vitamix by a mile on cleaning ease.POWER— it ate up chunks of frozen fruit with no problems.Price—great price for the functionality.ConsIt’s large. Requires a lot of room on counter or in cabinet. Does not fit under kitchen top cabinets.Blades are dangerously sharp.It blends a lot of air into smoothies. They end up a bit foamy. I haven’t had it long, so there may be ways to avoid this.If you need a blender primarily for smoothies or frozen cocktails, you can’t go wrong here!
"
Fat Boy,5.0,2022 15 August,"
This is the best blender I've ever had.  We use it mostly for fruit smoothies and it blends very well.  But one time I accidentally left a spoon in the blender, put the top in and started to blend.  I had added ice so figured the loud sound was the ice.  Instead, the spoon I had overlooked quickly blew a hole in the side of the container, and could have caused serious injuries had someone shorter than my 5'4"" been the user.  We got a replacement container and have been happily blending ever since.
"
"Catina Ryan,",5.0,2022 5 September,"
After my Breville died I needed another blender, but didn’t want to spend a lot as I’m saving for a Blendtec or vitamix. This is surprisingly good. It gets used at least twice a day for smoothies and does a great job. It handles ice and frozen berries like a champ.
"
Kagrange,5.0,2022 26 September,"
I love the extra blades and its so fast!!!! When blending you hit the button and its done!
"
M&M,5.0,2022 7 September,"
I went through THREE blenders before going with Ninja!  Has lasted for longer than three months and the ease of use and cleaning is a plus!  The only issue is I wish this model came with personal blender capability but otherwise would definitely recommend this blender.
"
LFaith,5.0,2022 19 September,"
I make a lot of ""blender salsa"" This blender is fabulous! It's very powerful and it mixes/ blends all ingredients so well and fast.  I highly recommend it
"
T.K.,4.0,2022 5 October,"
Great power, good for smoothies, but too big for small tasks like a cup of hollandaise.
"
BOARK,5.0,2022 29 September,"
It’s nice compact size doesn’t take a lot of counter space.
"
Bea,5.0,2022 22 August,"
I had an old Ninja and this is a huge step up. A great machine and so much more powerful. It is much easier to clean than the old one because for some reason there was an opening at the bottom of the old one that allowed whatever was being blended to get into a little opening in the base and it was very hard to clean. I highly recommend this one!

This is the best blender!  Blends frozen fruit so easily.  Great for smoothies
"
david kwok,4.0,2022 30 July,"
As a person that worked at a smoothie shop I could tell you that the smoothies that I have made with this blender, have the same results as the vitamin x blender that I used to work with. if you use all frozen fruits it will take a little more to blend but when using a combination of fresh and frozen is very quick and easy!My only complain is that it’s a little bit hard to wash but everything else is fine!
"
Jmc,5.0,2022 27 August,"
Wow! I put ice cubes in and hit high speed for a moment and my ice cubes were decimated!  This blender has tons of power.
"
Chipman,5.0,2022 22 August,"
Just be aware that the blades on this thing are not like typical blender blades. They are tiny samurai swords and they will cut you to ribbons if you are not careful. Treat the ninja with respect.
"
Kaitlyn W,4.0,2022 8 August,"
We already have a Ninja blender and bought this for a vacation home. It is a more basic model than the blender we have at home. Wish all the models had more functions. With that said, it does the job and they are more powerful than other blenders we've used. Ninja is definitely my favorite for the power.
"
Kathey Fatica,5.0,2022 23 July,"
I have had the same Ninja 1000W model for probably 12 years and it's a work horse. But it’s old and I have to hold the lid down in one corner to get the motor to engage. It was time to replace it. I looked at replacing it with models with more bells and whistles and figured why pay extra for features that I already have on my food processor which works just fine. So I gladly chose the same Ninja model I've used for many years... and hope it lasts another 12!
"
Ernie,5.0,2022 26 August,"
Get this blender, easy to clean, does what it’s suppose to do. Basically upgrade from a blender that’s been in the family for over 2 decades.
"
Marsha,5.0,2022 10 August,"
Haven't used this blender all that often yet, but everything I've made in it has come out great.  I've made fruit smoothies, milk drinks, and potato pancakes so far.  I'm sure I'll be using it for more things because it is easier to clean than my food processor.
"
Phil in Phoenix,4.0,2022 12 August,"
I’ve purchased much more expensive blender and this is far superior as far as power, ease of use and easy to pop into the dishwasher. I use my blender a lot for hummus that is thick and hard on a blender, this does it with ease. Glad I believed the reviews I read on Amazon
"
Montessahall,4.0,2022 14 August,"
The power is definitely there however, when blending for smoothness it misses the mark. The dates in my banana smoothies are left chunky rather than blended. The blades are sharp which requires care when cleaning to avoid cuts to hand or fingers.

Professional blender. Alot more fun than the single blade models.
"
Juan Diaz de Lindo,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Ninja is a well known brand and it seems for good reason. This is one of their entry level models and despite this and it's low price, it is more than capable of doing what most folks require of it.There's a lemonade I make that requires I blend the entire lemon with rind and all and this thing sliced and diced half a dozen of them easily. Same thing with the ice added later.Just be careful when cleaning as those blades are SHARP. I speak from lacerated experience.
"
Debbie Ramsey,5.0,2022 29 August,"
Like that it has several blades for even blending.  Easy clean up.
"
Chelsey,4.0,2022 18 July,"
I love this blender, EXCEPT that it won’t blend chia seeds into my smoothie. They just get spun around and stay whole. It crushes ice, blends veggies and fruits, but just not the chia seeds. Maybe I’m using it wrong? My old Oster blender would pulverize the chia seeds, but it lacked the power to crush ice and frozen fruits well, so this turned out to be the complete opposite of my old one!
"
Nina,5.0,2022 29 August,"
It's easy to use, easy to clean and very powerful! Just what I wanted.
"
Sandra,5.0,2022 21 July,"
I wanted a blender so I could make smoothies. I ordered this Ninja blender during Prime Days. I love its power. The center blades are not just on bottom but also at middle and top so blending is complete. Lid locks on so no chance of it popping off, and there’s a corner of the lid that has an opening topour contents without removing lid. On scale of 1 - 10, this blender is a definite 10.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The container measurement is off as to it being 72oz, I received a 64oz, just a bit deceiving. But, besides the container measurement difference, it's a pretty good blender. It did give a funny slite burning smell the first time I used it. It gets the job done

Shelley R Jennings,5.0,2022 3 August,"
This blender is awesome! It’s easy to clean ! A warning about the blades, they are sharp! This thing could shred a tree trunk if it fit in there I think. If you’re looking for a powerful blender that’s a breeze to clean, get the ninja!
"
Abdullah,5.0,2022 19 August,"
It blends so well. Works amazing for smoothies. And the blades come out, so you can clean easily without hurting yourself. I love this
"

Best blender ever!
"
Dave Staats,5.0,2022 18 July,"
Wow! That already had an Osterizer Classic top of the line blender but it wasn't handy for making big or double smoothies. This thing with the ""blade tree"" is fantastic. The canister goes on and off easily ad does the lid. It only costs as much as 10 smoothies. 8 oz frozen fruit and 8 oz OJ makes a great smoothie in less than a minute. Great machine! I also love their cookware.
"
Lisa Barrett,5.0,2022 20 August,"

"
Carrie E.,5.0,2022 18 August,"
Big, but super powerful!  Love the blades that go all the way up, so everything gets blended.
"
S.C.,4.0,2022 18 May,"
So far, I’ve only used this once. I’ve turned it on to clean it a couple of times, though. It did a good job of blending everything. All the frozen strawberries were blended. Almost all of the frozen bananas were as well. It left one tiny piece of banana, but to be fair, my nutribullet does the same thing sometimes. I’ll post an update if I have any other issues with it in the near future. The only complaint I have today is the fact that it does not come with the same cup in the picture. It says 72oz, but it’s really 64oz. It’s not the worst thing ever, but it’s deceiving.  If you look through the pictures, there’s an * with an explanation of it only being able to hold 64oz. Mine doesn’t even say 72oz on the cup. It says 64oz.

I use this product usually to make my morning smoothies. I wasn't expecting it to have the power it did. The way it obliterated my fruits and vegetables was quite impressive. Great power in this blender, worth a buy. And it's power can be moderate too, if that's what you like.
"
Brenda Harmon,5.0,2022 16 July,"

"
Soy La,4.0,2022 1 April,"
The blender works great so far but the first few uses it let off a smoky smell as if it was being overused and about to go out. I’m not sure why since I use more than enough liquid and I’ve only used fruits such as banana, mangoes and strawberries. I’m wondering how long this will actually work before it clocks out due to this . But as I said so far it’s blended with great power , so I have hope . Also the last two times, I didn’t notice the smell so maybe it was just a “breaking it in “ smell.Oh and I also didn’t like the fact that the blade doesn’t snap in. It just sits in there , which is fine overall, it was just off putting at first.

Although my other one had a pour spot, this one does not.  But that's OK, I love this ninja.  I made strawberry smoothie in it and another day pineapple smoothie.  Used ice, etc.  Was fantastic.  Very fast n efficient.  Love, love,  love  this blender.

Trini C,5.0,2022 8 July,"
I was previously using an old blender to make smoothies until it died. It was the traditional four blades on the bottom and was quite noisy. I tried my new Ninja and the six blades that rotate throughout the picture make mixing far less noisy and efficient. The only thing I would advise is to use caution when cleaning the blades.

"
Anakronism,3.0,2022 15 August,"
I bought this blender for multiple daily use before and after gastric bypass surgery. I really loved it at first despite it being loud. It completely pulverized ice and made the smoothest shakes. However after only one month of use the blades have tiny little dings in them and the texture of my protein shakes has become crunchy from small chunks of ice that no longer blend to a smooth consistency. It's a good little blender but if you're planning on using it daily for things with ice in it, I wouldn't recommend it.

JenDiggity,2.0,2022 25 August,"
It doesn’t blend things entirely smooth even when you blend then let it sit for like half an hour in between three blend sessions to try and make sure everything is getting soft and absorbing fluid. Like BREAD will not blend. Wet bread is too tough for it. The controls are lousy (why no timed blend???). The blades are annoying to clean and don’t try and pour anything out with the blades still in because it’ll fall right out. I needed this for my son’s puréed food and it is wholly inadequate. And somehow I ordered TWO then proceeded to get Covid and be so sick I missed the return window so now I have two TERRIBLE blenders. What a waste of money. I’d buy the Instant Pot Ace blender again if they didn’t stop making it because of constant bearing issues. At least it could blend smoothly! I shouldn’t have to pay $400 for a decent blender! You manufacturers need to step up your game.

 Blended okay. Had to add more liquid so it wasn’t a paste. Decent. Kinda big for one single person. Very very loud. If it was quieter it could work. Idk I feel like it’s too much.Blending is okayClean is okayNoise level on 100.I’m making my smoothies early in the morning so I don’t wanna wake up everybody

The blades are very dangerous..they go up so high I cut myself badly during first use. The blender itself did not puree ice like I thought it would in my smoothie it left big pieces so I had to return it unfortunately it just did not have the blending power I needed.
"
Michael R. Barsteika,2.0,2022 23 May,"
I received this blender on 5/20/2022 and it wouldn't blend my smoothie today (5/23/2022) regardless of how much liquid I put in.  I turned it on after taking all the ingredients out of the carafe and the blades spun perfectly.  I put just a small amount back in and they would barely turn.  I put more in with some MORE liquid and the blades wouldn't move at all.I'm returning it and looking for a different blender because there is no way I'm wasting $70 on something that works like this.
"
CJ,2.0,2022 28 July,"
Blender seems very good the two times I’ve used it. Somehow already chipped the plastic bottom pretty significantly though with cracks extending pretty far. Not that sturdy on the plastic so protection plan may actually be worth it.

It has great power and works awesome! Blenderizes like I've never seen before. Unfortunately after 2 uses the bottom of the blender container itself cracked so now it leaks. Really disappointed about this. Having spent almost $100 I expected better quality.
"
Anne,1.0,2022 23 August,"
I loved the single-serve Ninja I’ve had for years, and recently bought this one because I figured I could use it for smoothies as well as cooking. Nope. So far I’ve only tried smoothies, and they come out a disgusting, gritty, grainy texture. I’m used to the Ninja single-serve blenders that do a great job of mixing everything up. This one will not give you the same result—expect ingredients to stick to the sides since it’s a square shape.
"
Ulua.kayak,1.0,2022 30 July,"
After two uses, the plastic on the Jat turn really foggy. Looks like from mixing ice and frozen fruits. Yes, I add ebough liquids, but it turns like the pictures shown. I have to return it, because I don't want to eat plastic with my Smooties. Other than that, no complain for everything else. I wish it has a better plastic quality.
"
yvonne medina,1.0,2022 17 July,"
The description on the website saids it’s a 72oz pitcher and I received a 64oz pitcher, I didn’t realize until I used it and had already threw the box away , I don’t want a refund I just want the correct pitcher but the only options on the website it’s to return item, otherwise the blender works great.

Ashley Russell,1.0,2022 26 April,"
Do not buy this it’s horrible it makes noise and smoke to the very first time we used it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they would not take it because our return window had closed. We keep it in our second home so we didn’t have a chance to use it before a return window closed. This company does not stand behind its products!!!
"
Steven Knoll,1.0,2022 5 September,"
The plastic top is already broken after only about 4 times of using it. Would not buy again plus all the ingredients stick to the side and don’t get mixed in.

This Ninja NJ601AMZ Professional Blender is a large and powerful Blender.  It has a 1000 watt motor and a large capacity Pitcher.  The pitcher has a 64oz max liquid capacity.  The pitcher is plastic and is lightweight but feels pretty durable.  It blends really well, sometimes too well.  My son likes to makes smoothies and this blends them up quickly and really well too.  The blades can be removed to clean, but beware they are sharp, have to be careful when they are in the dishwasher.  This Ninja blender definitely packs a punch and blends really well.

Julie,5.0,2022 7 June,"
This blender works as well as the Vitamix we own. It may mix a little better and faster even with the blade placement throughout. Personally, I prefer the blades at the bottom because I like to use a spatula to scrape out all of the smoothie, and there isn't room for a spatula between the blades and the sides of this mixer. But that's the only drawback I've found. Otherwise, this blender works great -- definitely upgrade from the typical blender.
"
Mad Max,4.0,2021 23 December,"
This is a great blender for the price. After testing several top brands here are my notes:Keep in mind this Ninja is only 1,000 watts. For most people and most applications that's more than adequate, I'm not sure why people are so fixated on wattage instead of the more important aspects of a good blender. But just be aware, the high end brands do offer more wattage. Vitamix ranges from1100-1400, Blendtec offers 1500 and 1800 options, and the larger Ninja is 1500.The most consistently highest rated blender in the world is the Vitamix. They are workhorses, last forever, and crush anything. The second highest rated blender is Blendtec, for the same reasons. And I agree, they are the best built with superior motors.However, I will say the Ninja beats them on versatility. Also keep in mind you can add the Ninja food processor attachment to this (it doesn't come with one, but our old one fits it just fine).Having said all of that, my personal favorite is the Dash Chef Series Deluxe 64 oz Blender. It does not have attachments like the Ninja, but I find it to be extremely versatile, 1400 watt motor, and the easiest to use with the most settings. It has presets for smoothies, chopping ice, soups, ice cream, nut butter, a self-cleaning option, and it will even charge your phone or tablet. It has a built-in tablet stand (for when you're cooking), and it was the quietest of all the blenders I tested.The sticker price on the Dash is $229, so more than twice as much as this basic Ninja. If I have just $100 to spend, I would get this Ninja (or wait for the Ninja blender/food processor to go on sale). If I had $200 to spend, I would save up and get the Dash.One final note - on modern blenders, the motor isn't usually the first thing to fail. The digital buttons and dials are usually the first thing to fail. That's another reason the Vitamix is so well rated, because the electronics are simpler, it uses old fashioned knobs that don't fail. Still, though, I prefer the Dash.
"
T,4.0,2021 24 December,"
So far this blender works well for me. It is definitely a bit loud. It also seems a bit… much- the big lid that has to go on a certain way, the button you have to push to release it, the pour spout hole, the ginormous blades.. please note-apparently the blades are not attached and you need to remove them before pouring. I made a smoothie that ended up being thicker than I meant for, so I couldn’t pour it through that little pour hole. The blades came shooting out and just missed my hand. Thank goodness, because those blades are sharp I know they would have done damage.This blender has a large capacity which is nice when I need it. I find myself reaching for my old blender because it just seems smaller and less bulky.I was very excited for this blender. This blender does work good, it blends as a blender should, nothing special to me though. It still misses occasional chunks when blending, just like my old blender. This one is more work to clean though.
"
Christie W.,4.0,2022 14 January,"
This blender is powerful. I can't say if it does the job better than my cheaper blender, though. It does seem a little quieter. And the pitcher holds 72 oz whereas my other blender holds 48oz. I'm not comfortable with using it with anything hot since it is a plastic pitcher... The blade only seems securely in place when the lid is on, when I poured out my drink the blade came too.
"
Yashahime,4.0,2022 5 January,"
I do gotta admit that the blades of this blender are razor sharp be careful and weary when you are cleaning and using this blender. At first sight this blender is pretty standard in size and really packs a punch.This blender has a standard open cap or a halfway open cap depending on how you want to use it. The blender has a twist and lock style so the actual blender does not shake off the machine. The machine is really powerful and is able to blend frozen fruits into a smoothly easily. It's also super easy to disassemble and also clean, you can put some detergent along with hot water and run the blender.If you are looking for something that packs a punch and works flawlessly this is a great option.
"
Jeffrey Van Wagoner,5.0,2022 10 February,"
We have had this blender for a couple of months and have made many smoothies, hummus, and puréed soup. Other reviewers have mentioned that the container has cracked, but so far, ours has held strong. I will update this review if that changes. I love that this blender is simple to use as there are only four buttons. It is a nice-looking blender and feels very sturdy. It came well packaged and in excellent condition. The smoothies are delicious and nice and smooth if you let it run for long enough- otherwise, there may be ice chunks. The square shape helps with the contents blending instead of just spinning like they sometimes do in a round blender. The lid is a little tricky, and my kids struggle with it when they are helping, as there is only one way you can put it on, and the handle has to be up and then locked down. It is nice that it locks. The pour spout is also good and is much less drippy than our last blender, so we don't end up with smoothies all over the table. My favorite feature about this blender is that it is easy to clean. There is no need to unscrew things - take the blade out, and you can easily hand wash the pitcher without slicing your fingers, or fill the whole thing with some soapy water, blend it on high, and rinse. The blade is a little scary to handle, as it is three blades that go all the way around. Overall we are pleased with this blender. I've always wanted a VitaMix, and although this blender is not quite as nice, it works great for us.
"
Shala Kerrigan,5.0,2022 25 March,"
My family LOVES Ninja kitchen appliances, so let's get that out of the way first. It definitely affects reviews because just seeing the name inspires trust in my family full of pretty decent cooks and they put them through their paces.This is a nice blender, it has done well with everything we've thrown into it. While I do have a combination Ninja food processor/blender, this is the blender we use for smoothies, etc. It handles nuts and other things like a dream.
"
Two kids mom,4.0,2021 15 December,"
The best thing about these Ninja blenders is that the blades go all the way up the stem. These means they circulate the ingredients much better than a blender with just bottom blades and you spend less time scraping stuff back down to get it to blend.This one has enough power to really chop ice to the size you can use for drinks.You can only put 64 ounces in it, it needs room at the top.It is straightforward with just 3 buttons and a pulse button. That is really all you need. The fact that they are flat makes them easier to clean.I will say, look around. The prices on these Ninjas vary a lot, and you can get one with more power at the some price, with maybe a few less buttons. Some even come with the smoothie cups, which this one does not.  So think about what you want before buying and look at all the available models.I am taking a star because at the current 100 price this should come with some smoothie cups, a more powerful but older version of this comes with two and costs 10 bucks less.

datura2002,4.0,2021 24 December,"
This Ninja NJ601AMZ blender is powerful (1000 watts) and not too loud.  It's easy to use and also easy to clean; the pitcher is even dishwasher safe.  The only thing I don't like is that the pitcher is plastic.  I prefer the all-metal pitchers of vintage Vitamix blenders, but blenders these days don't seem to offer that.  It comes with a booklet of 10 recipes to get you started.
"
Boyzoo,4.0,2022 4 June,"
Very nice blender for the price. It is no vitamix, but it holds a lot and the jar isn't too heavy.  Works great and has a small countertop footprint.
"
Ian D.,5.0,2022 19 January,"
This blender is fairly large (definitely full-sized, and not personal-sized), and it makes fast work of most things you might wish to blend. It doesn't have the same power as some of the most powerful blenders on the market, but it provides a good balance of blending power and economical price. If you start getting up to the 1500 watt power rating, you'll be spending at least $150 or more, depending on the brand you go for. With this, you get a great amount of power (1000 watts) from a very well-known brand, and it's just $100. Some of the benefits of this:1. The blending blades go up the middle of blender rather than just sitting at the bottom. You have extra blades, which means that it blends evenly top to bottom, without much chance of things getting stuck to the sides and not blending.2. It's large, but it looks pretty nice and professional, similar to what you might see in smoothie places.3. The power is enough to get through most anything. It crushes ice in smoothies, resulting in a very uniform result. It works to blend soups, sauces, purees, etc. I haven't found something it can't get through effectively and quickly.Overall, for the price, it's great. Unless you know you'll need to really blend some tough stuff, this should be enough for most home uses.

 I was intrigued and impresssed by this nice-appearing blender until I realized that the same basic blender is available in a higher-powered version with more features for $10 less than the price being charged for this model here on Amazon. You can find the better, less expensive, blender here: https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-BN701-Professional-capacity-Crushing/dp/B0855B5Z6F/.So I can see no real reason to recommend this blender at $99, despite the fact that it's a capable blender. But the Ninja BN701 Professional Plus Bender has 1400 watts of power to this blender's 1000 watts, and three programmed functions for making smoothies, frozen drinks and blending ice cream that this blender lacks. And it costs $89.If you get this blender, be careful of the blade. Like other Ninja blender blades, it's exceedingly sharp.Otherwise, this is a capable basic blender from Ninja.
"
Baazumi,5.0,2022 12 February,"
Powerful blender that handles ice really well and makes great smoothies.  It also purees vegetables and soups that come out nice and creamy.  The jar holds 72 ounce which is quite a lot and is easy to clean. A biton the noisy side as all blenders are these days.  Great price for what you get.
"
I love Stuff,5.0,2021 14 December,"
This is a really nice blender. Build quality is plastic, but quality plastic. Nothing feels flimsy or fragile. Everything works well from the buttons to the lid. That isn't what makes this blender stand out though. Its the blades. Every other blender with just one set of bottom blades makes crushing ice annoying. You have constant move the ice or add tons of liquid. Since these blades go all the way up the stem, ice or pretty much anything blends easily without stirring or with minimal stirring. Why don't other blenders do this? It is like every company out there releases the same blender over and over again. This style of blade is by far the best I have ever used. The price on this unit is also stellar for the wonderful blending this unit does. There is no other blender in the same price range that blends as well as this does.
"
Lycanroc,5.0,2022 9 January,"
The blades are super sharp, which is great for the slicing. It worked really great for smoothies. I'm excited to try this out with other things.One thing I have to note is that there was a somewhat discernible smell when running the blender, but it was nothing too concerning. I'll update this review if anything happens to it.
"
Dusty Trails,5.0,2022 3 January,"
This blender is what to expect from a Ninja product. The pitcher is a nice size, and the blades are super sharp. I pureed some oranges quickly and effortlessly with this beast. Time will tell how it holds up. I will say I feel like the blender is too powerful for the materials it is built with, which may shorten its life, but way too early to tell. For now I have no complaints though and highly recommend for a powerful blender.
"
Tom,5.0,2021 19 December,"
A nice sized, all purpose blender. Simple push button operation without the fancy program modes. The Ninja blenders do a great job with ice and are perfect for frozen drinks. Generous 72 ounce capacity, but you'll not want to fill it up that much unless you want a big mess on your hands. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe to boot.

 Pros:-The main thing I use a blender for is to make frozen cocktails. The ninja blender is the only one I have ever used that gives a thick consistency like you would get when going to a restaurant.-This can make snow out of ice cubes, I love using this for making certain cocktails like mint juleps.-Blender works great for all other needs. When making smoothies, it really liquifies most of the pulp, but there is still a very small trace of pulp that will be noticed when drinking.-Overall the blender is easy to use. Just keep in mind the blender has safety mechanisms so the lid must be on correctly, as well as the base, otherwise it won’t operate.Considerations:-The blade on this blender is very sharp. I am always nervous washing. However, as long as you are careful, it isn’t an issue.-This blender is a little taller than my past blenders and can’t fit below my cabinets on my counter.-This blender isn’t as strong as some of the other ninja blenders at only 1000 watts. My other blender is 1200 watts. However, I noticed that it still makes snow just as well.

I have a much more expensive blender that I've had for years and decided to give this a try. I make green shake smoothies every morning for my family and I am blown away at the power of this machine. It crushes ice incredibly well and puree's everything into a nice smooth consistency. This is really important for me because my daughter can't have ANY chunks even the tiniest chunk in any of her smoothies and this pulverizes everything so well! What a great price for such a powerful blender. Love it
"
B Wallis,3.0,2022 29 April,"
Ninja usually makes top-of-the-line stuff. And I am obsessed for a reason. So I thought this blender would be an excellent addition to my growing collection of Ninja kitchen goodies. Wrong.At first? The blender worked GREAT. Not too noisy. Nice balance of power for the price, and I do mean that! It's awesome for smoothies, gravies and soups, which is ALL I have used it for. One day I heard a little crack sound and there's a little crack forming at one corner of the jar. Not even any ice cubes or anything in there heavy.It hasn't full on cracked open but I am watching it closely. I don't like having to use an appliance wondering about another shoe potentially dropping in the form of a blender jar cracking open mid-cycle.Will it crack all the way? I don't know. I think it's the vibrations of the unit that cause that. I've never had a blender jar crack on me before, even the esteemed old blender my mother has been using for 30 years.I will update if it cracks all the way. In the meantime, I also noticed it's starting to have a hard time blending my spinach for smoothies. This makes me sad, I prefer to blend my greens for the added fiber benefit. Not sure I want chunks like this in my smoothies. I have to run it a little longer just to get it all, and increasingly finding bits in my smoothies.
"
Wade N,3.0,2022 10 February,"
I really liked the strength and the power of this Ninja NJ601 blender in blending and mixing a variety of food and ingredients. It does not produce a very annoying noise. The blades are very sharp and are very successful in crushing and mixing a wide range of compounds. The cleaning of the pitcher and the blades is easy and the pitcher has a fairly large size which makes it suitable for soup blending, making large amounts of frozen drinks and shakes.There are also some issues that I noticed with this model. Firstly, the pitcher material (BPA-free plastic) does not seem to be very durable and is not very resistant to some scratches that might happen during the ice crushing. I also noticed that there are some other models available from Ninja with more powerful motors (1400 or 1100 Watts) at the same price. For instance, Ninja BN701 and Ninja BL660  are equipped with stronger motors with exactly the same price (at the moment) and as I know, the motor power is directly related to the crushing and mixing power of the blender! Another issue that I noticed is the relatively weak front panel design. I see that on some other models, Ninja has done a much better job to give a variety of options to users to choose the type of mixture that they want. Here, we only see 3 power settings and this may not be so easy for some beginner users to choose the right power for their blending.Overall, the blender does a great job of doing the main functions of blending and crushing and the blades seem to be durable (based on the time that I've been using the blender!). However, I personally expected a better design and some more features from the Ninja and its current blender (Ninja NJ601AMZ).

I make a lot of smoothies, and my cheap $30 Oster did a better job than this thing. Square pitcher with circular blades = can't blend the little bits.

I really love Ninja Foodie. Always been a fan of Ninja Foodie. I have purchased it mostly for my morning fruits and greens smoothie. It blends perfectly and makes my Smoothie really tasty. Highly Highly recommended anyone for getting one of those!!!

I have had this blender for a few months. And I love it. It’s easy to clean and the power is still the same. I mainly use it for my smoothies. Be careful with cleaning the blade because it’s very sharp. But other than that it’s work like a dream.

Blades are amazingly effective. They are sharp, of course. Took a block of cheese and a slice of dry bread and made a breading in seconds.

Crushes ice and blends the vegetables and fruits good enough for me. Must use strainer or cheesecloth to get only the juice.  For the price it works well.

Aunque no es tan trivial en su uso y limpieza dado que las aspas tienen mucho filo, el resultado de usarlo no se compara: los jugos y molidas son homogéneas, su capacidad es muy buena y el material esta pensado para que lucir y trabajar como se debe. De mis mejores compras.
